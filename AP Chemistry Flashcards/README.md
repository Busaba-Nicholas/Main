**Once downloaded open up the ".exe" (you may need to bypass Windows Defender)**

When enrolling in AP Chemistry for the 2020-2021 academic year, we were tasked with memorizing a bunch of information relating to elements and compounds.

Since we were often required to memorize 3 things at a time (Element, Abbreviation, charge) Quizlet would not have worked. 
So I decided to use Unity to make my own program with "3 sided" flashcards.

Since this was made quickly it isn't very intuitive so I'll explain how it works (some keybinds and options may not exist depending on the version you are using)

Keybinds/Hotkeys:
  - left and right arrow keys to change flashcard
  - up and down arrow keys to flip the 3 sided flashcard
  - 'z' to 'm' changes the section of what you are studying (can also click the buttons at the bottom
  - '1' to '3' change with flashcard is defaulted to when switching between them (slider at the top left also works)
  - 'q' opens/closes the periodic table (can also click the button at the top right but it's a bit bugged)
  - 'r' randomizes the order of the flashcards in that specific section from the number of the top slider to the number on the bottom slider (can also click randomize at the top right)
  - 'e' resets randomization in that section
  
Other notes:
  - Only supports 16:9 ratio, changing it causing graphical problems
  - Not GPU optimized
  - Only tested on Windows
  - Alt + Enter can be used to enter and exit fullscreen
