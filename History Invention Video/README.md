This is an entertaining video about an invention during the Industrial Revolution.

Here are some facts and context about it:
  - Created after the English Trailer Video
  - We were given an invention and had to talk about who made it and how it worked
  - Used a different style to the English trailer
  - Voiced by me (with more consistent microphone quality)
  - Made everyone, even the teacher, laugh really hard while I was presenting
