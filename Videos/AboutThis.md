Throughout school, I made a few videos for presentations. So I will explain each video and its context. 

Files are a ".zip" because of the 25mb file size limit

"AAAAAAAA DONE" is the English Trailer I made:
  - Titled that because I was happy to be done with it after all the work put into it and I wanted to easily find it at the top of my files
  - After reading a short story for class (forgot name) I was tasked with making an illustration
  - I decided to make a trailer for my illustration, and despite what the teacher expected I made it animated
  - **Background music (hard to hear) is taken from _iMovie_**
  - First time using the software for more than experimentation
  - All voices were done by me (with varying microphone qualities)
  - It was a  successful presentation since everyone paid attention to it

"Shark_Tank" is a History project about an invention in the Industrial Age:
  - We were given an invention and had to talk about who made it and how it worked
  - **Images in the video aren't mine and I take no credit in their creation**
  - Different style to the English trailer
  - Voiced by me (with more consistent microphone quality)

"FinalProjectExport" is a final project in a different History Class:
  - We had to talk about different aspects in a certain decade, and I did the 1860s
  - **Images in the video aren't mine and I take no credit in their creation**
  - A different style to the previous two videos since this is more informative
  - Complimented later for the video by peers

"Math-Textbook" is a gif I made as a small one off
 - Can lag when first opened
 - We had to show out textbook with a cover on
 - I had fun with it and made this
 - The teacher even presented all of ours "pictures" to the class and everyone laughed at mine
