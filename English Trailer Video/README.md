**Background music (hard to hear) is taken from _iMovie_ and other non-voice audio doesn't belong to me**

This is the trailer I made for an English class presentation.

Here are some facts and context about it:
  - First time using the software for more than experimentation on available tools
  - Titled the video what it is because I was happy to be done with it after all the work put into it and I wanted to easily find it at the top of my files
  - After reading a short story for class (don't know the name anymore) I was tasked with making an illustration
  - I decided to make a trailer for my illustration, and despite what everyone expected I made it animated
  - All voices were done by me (with varying microphone qualities)
  - While looking on it now there is a lot of room for improvement, it was a very successful presentation with everyone laughing throughout the entire thing
