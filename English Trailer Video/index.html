            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p>
              During English class in 9th grade we were assigned with a group project to summarize a short story
              in various ways to deeply inform other peers. I was assgined with the creative aspect of the story 
              and decided to make a short video of the story in a humerus way.
              <br><br>
              At the time I was unaware of a lot of video editing procedures. I mainly just knew how to open
              up the software and make rectangles. My skills have far eclipsed what is shown here, but as a first
              big video project its a nice checkpoint in my life.
              <br><br>
              This video includes many interesting aspects. This includes many layers of video, animations that convey movement,
              self recorded audio, overlapping audio, subtitles, and a consistent flow. Despite looking at it now as a checkpoint,
              I'll never forget what it was like to see the entire class burst out into laughter from hours of hard work.
