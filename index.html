                My name is Nicholas Busaba. I am a senior attending Spackenkill Highschool and planning to pursue a degree in Computer Science/Engineering.
                I enjoy video editing, animating, programming, and creating graphical applications.
                Feel free to reach out to me at: "busabaN2014@verizon.net", I'll be glad to hear from you.

            <u> Why This was made </u>
            <div class = "Text"> 
                To share the work I've created I made a <a href="https://github.com/Busaba-Nicholas/Main">Github</a> page.
                I then learned that Github can host websites.
                I originally used it to have my Unity projects usable without downloading, but I then realized I could go further and decided to make everything easier to use for people like you and make a full-on website.

            <u> How this was made </u>
            <div class = "Text"> 
                To enhance my website development skills, I built this from the ground up without using a template.
