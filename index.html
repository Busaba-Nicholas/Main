            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Nicholas Busaba. I'm currently Sophmore attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
              I'm a Computer Science and Information Technology Web Science Dual major. I've taken classes like
              Data Structures to enhance my knowledge on trees, hasmaps, and lists along with the appropriate use
              cases for all of them. I've also taken Intro to ITWS to learn the basics of web development and 
              database management. I'm currently taking Computer Organization to learn about assembly and hardware
              along with Web Systems Development to learn more about web development and cyber security.
              <br><br>
              In my free time I partake in ethical game hacking. This involves looking into low level hardware 
              components of emulated hardware such as the RAM, CPU registers, assembly instructions, and setting
              breakpoints appropriately. With this knowledge I've created many scripts and assembly edits to alter
              the game's behavior. I've deeply learned concepts such pointers, registers, endianess, variable encoding,
              memory alignment, and PowerPC assembly.
              <br><br>
              This website was created from the ground up for the sole purpose of showcasing what I've done. It's 
              made in such a way that outside of WebGL, javascript isn't needed. Everything relies on HTML and CSS.
              Some of these may include school projects, or personal projects created because I'm passionate for 
              the subject. All of these projects are below, and thanks to this website, are all easy to navigate through.

              for all possibilities for an upcoming exam.
