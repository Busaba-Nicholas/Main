            <div class = "Text"> 
                My name is Nicholas Busaba. I am a senior attending Spackenkill Highschool currently looking for a college to attend.
                <br>
                If you want to email me about anything, my email is "busabaN2014@verizon.net".

            <u> Why This was made </u>
            <div class = "Text"> 
                To make sure colleges knew I actually did make what I talk about in my college essay and supplements I made a Github page with my personal projects.
                <br>
                I then learned that Github can host websites. I originally used it to have my Unity projects usable without downloading, but I then realized I could go further and decided to make everything easier to use for people like you and make a full-on website.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "Header">
            <u> How this was made </u>
            <div class = "Text"> 
                Unlike most, I didn't copy a free file to do all the formatting for you. I typed everything myself (except everything relating to running the Unity Projects). I frequently looked at the internet for help because otherwise, this would've been impossible.
