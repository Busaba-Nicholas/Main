**Images in the video aren't mine and I take no credit for their creation**

This is an imformative video where I describe many aspects of a decade and than was required to present it.

Here are some facts and context about it:
  - I was assigned with the 1860s
  - One of the few students who didn't just use a slideshow presentation to communicate their ideas
  - Decided to overegagerate facts and show pictures of what I'm talking about to get the message communicated clearly
  - Done over a remote year, so I couldn't hear everyone's reaction
  - Complimented later for the video by peers
