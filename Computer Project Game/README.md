At the end of a Computer Science class, I was tasked with doing something new to learn more about programming.
I then decided to use Unity for the first time after hearing a lot about it. So while not perfect this is where I learned most of my skills.
I followed an online tutorial on Youtube closely (can't find videos anymore) so you may find similar assets online.
Since the project was under a time limit, I was unable to finish it leaving lots of underused mechanics, cut content, and bugs.

What the game is:
  - A platformer where you play as a ball
  - There are platforms of multiple different colors
  - Each color means something else (since this wasn't finished you won't see a lot of them or they are underused
  - You have to make the proper jumps to make it to the end

Controls:
  - 'w' to jump/walljump (depends on sprite) **and** fall slightly slower
  - 'a' to move left
  - 'd' to move right
  - 's' to fall faster in the air **and** morph into the ground to jump higher
  - 'm' + 'space' + 'arrow key' to gain access to debug movement

Other Notes:
  - 1920x1080 is the only non-fullscreen resolution usable
  - Alt + Enter can be used to enter and exit fullscreen
  - Very poorly optimized for the GPU
  - Only tested on Windows
  - Sometimes you can collide in the ground in a way where movement is restricted (jump to fix it)
