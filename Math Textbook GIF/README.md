This is a fun one-off side project where I decided to show I properly covered my textbook.

Here are some facts and context about it:
 - Can lag when first opened
 - We just had to show our face, textbook, and a textbook cover
 - The teacher decided to show everyone's picture of their textbook to the class which made me realize a GIF could be submitted
 - I had a lot of fun making this especially because of the reaction the students would get from it
 - When mine was shown everyone started laughing really hard
