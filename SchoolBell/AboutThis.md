When the pandemic started I originally used the alarms on my computer to get to class on time, but they had lots of problems.
So, I made my own program using Unity that will allow me to customize when the bells ring relative to class starting and stopping
Features include:
  - Having the decision of whether or not the bell rings at the start or end of a certain period
  - Having the bell ring up to two minutes earlier to get a warning
  - Forcing the bell to ring when class starts/stops no matter the delay put
  - Telling you the current time (on your pc) and current period
Other notes:
  - Alt + Enter to fullscreen
  - Not having a 16:9 ratio breaks the UI
