Hello, I'm Nicholas Busaba, and I enjoy programming in Unity and the occasional video editing and animation.

Here I will post personal projects I made during my free time throughout the years.

To make your viewing experience easier to read and understand I created a website with all the same information above. The link is https://busaba-nicholas.github.io/Main/index.html.

Feel free to contact me at "busabaN2014@verizon.net".
