Hello, I'm Nicholas Busaba, and I enjoy programming in Unity and the occasional video editing and animation.

Here I will post personal projects I made during my free time throughout the years.

Each folder will have an "README.md" that explains more about what I created

Website that contains all the same information but easier to read https://busaba-nicholas.github.io/Main/index.html
